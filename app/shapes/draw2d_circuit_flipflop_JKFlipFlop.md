# JK-FlipFlop

## Description

The `JK flip-flop` is a simple enhancement of the SR flip-flop 
where the state J=K=1 is not forbidden. It works just like a 
SR flip-flop where J is serving as set input and K serving 
as reset. The only difference is that for the formerly 
*forbidden* combination **J=K=1** this flip-flop now performs 
an action: it inverts its state. As the behavior of the 
JK flip-flop is completely predictable under all conditions,
this is the preferred type of flip-flop for most logic
circuit designs.
